# Behaviour of ryoku-cmd-record around GPU Screen Recorder (GSR), run against a
# stand-in gpu-screen-recorder so no GPU or display is needed. It pins what users
# hit: a machine without a hardware encoder must still record (CPU, or another
# hardware codec), a failed GSR probe must never block a capture, region boxes go
# straight to -w, and a capture that dies explains itself (an NVIDIA update that
# needs a restart, a session with no GPU driver, or GSR's own words).
